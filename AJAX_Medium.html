<!--MEDIUM: Using a weather API, fetch and display weather for Charlotte to a webpage that you create. The webpage that you use can either be a simple page that just shows the data you receive from the API, or you can integrate it with your personal website. You should display at a minimum temperature and sky conditions. This API: http://weathers.co/api is free, simple, and doesn't require an account to be created. You can browse other weather APIs here if you would like to use something else: https://www.programmableweb.com/category/weather/api.
MEDIUM (BONUS): Add an input field and button on your page that let's the user enter a city and update the weather to the city of their choosing. Handle errors if a user enters bad input.-->
